## Things to do after Joining:
1. Check out the official [website](https://sites.google.com/view/cyb3rjunk/home) for Cyber-Junk/#100daysofcodewithcyberjunk. Join the exclusive Discord community, [here](https://discord.gg/ZmCmkw2enz), Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CyberJunk15)
2. Read Rules.
3. **Fork this repo and commit every day for the next 100 days**.
4.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days**.
5.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
6.  Change the date in [LOG](LOG.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
7.  Delete the illustration in the [**LOG**](LOG.md) and start with your own.
8.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #100daysofcode hashtag and tag @CyberJunk_ .**
9.  **Important:** (see No.5 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple of people (or more) right away.
10.  If you find an outstanding, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or tweet to me (see info below)
