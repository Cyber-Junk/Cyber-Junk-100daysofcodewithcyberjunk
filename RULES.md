# Rules for the 100 Days of Code Challenge

## Pledge
> **I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.**

## Additional Rules:
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> by tagging [@CyberJunk15](https://twitter.com/CyberJunk15) & using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode. 
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
4. I will update the [Log](LOG.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.

## To-Do to be More Productive:
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](LOG.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/).
3. If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/).
4. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
